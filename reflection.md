what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- I'm very please with the outcome of this project, and I've grown a lot since the start of CS30. I really could've done better on the game itself after the server communication code was finished, but that was just an issue of available work time. my nice to have list ended up non feasible in the way that more than two players would've not worked well the way I ended up creating the game, and real-time aim projection for the enemy didn't make sense either because of server rate-limits as well as the enemy not being in frame being integral to gameplay.
did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
- yes

What was the hardest part of the project?
- the hardest part of the project, was making both clients see the same results when the cannon is fired. I found the logic required to reach the result to be very mentally draining and hard to think about.

Were there any problems you could not solve?
- I couldn't add a reconnection system, but I'm confident I could figure it out with more time, although it was never a requirement to begin with.
