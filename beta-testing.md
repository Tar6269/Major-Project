notes: only advantage that beta testers had was that I asked them to either join or host. If you've had any experience with games, the concept of host and join is extremely common knowledge

beta test #1
    subject: Hunter, friend with very limited computer science knowledge 

    -seeing the host and join buttons, it was fairly obvious what he had to do to get into the game. I told him I would host. I hosted a server, and he joined without any hiccups.
    played one match without any bugs, except for hitboxes needed slight adjustments

beta test #2
    subject: Josh, friend with no computer science knowledge at all

    -seeing the host and join buttons, it was fairly obvious what he had to do to get into the game. I hosted a server, and he joined without any hiccups.
    played one match without any bugs to speak of.
