# CS30 Major Project Proposal

recreation of raft wars flash game, with working online multiplayer, 2D physics based projectiles, winning and losing.

## Need to have

- working two player multiplayer across online networks

- working game mechanics, win/loss implemented

- game mechanics include shooting a projectile, camera following projectile when it goes past viewing distance, and projectile impacting ship making it sink

## Nice to have

- more than two clients at a time

- real time aiming projections across both clients (sort of like an angry birds slingshot)
